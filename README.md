# YourMissal

Cross-platform progressive web app optimized for mobile and tablet-sized devices.

## Purpose
Missal books can be relatively cumbersome, usually totaling in excess of 1,800 pages. In spite of their length, they are yet unable to contain the vast library of edifying Catholic materials. YourMissal aims to ameliorate this problem by allowing anyone with an electronic device to access the full text of a Missal, Hymnal, Sacred Scripture, prayer books like the Raccolta, and more.

## Future Goals
Considering the potential scandal of using an electronic device as a Missal at Mass, the ultimate goal will be to incorporate this proejct with hardware: an e-Ink tablet purposefully designed to contain all of the materials Catholics commonly need. By making a device for *only* this purpsoe, the distraction that integrating the app into a mobile phone or tablet can be eliminated, along with the potential scandal of the use of such a device during such a solemn ceremony as the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
